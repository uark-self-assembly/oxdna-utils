# oxdna-utils
An open-source repository for the betterment of oxDNA-related scripts

Currently, the oxDNA scripts included with the [oxDNA source code](https://sourceforge.net/projects/oxdna/) lack stability, best practices, and updatability.
This repository seeks to be the hub for the betterment of existing scripts, and a place to contribute more scripts that can
benefit a wider community.

This repository also seeks to provide more meaningful documentation for scripts that are otherwise complicated or do not have readily apparent meaning.
